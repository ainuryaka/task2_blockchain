# NFT Minter dApp

This project is a simple dApp that allows users to mint NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) on the Ethereum blockchain. Users can connect their Ethereum wallet, input the necessary details for the NFT and mint it through the application.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>


# Smart Contract
The NFT smart contract is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain using the ERC-721 standard. It allows users to mint new NFTs by providing the necessary details and linking the metadata to the IPFS network.

# IPFS Integration
The project integrates with IPFS to store the metadata of the NFTs. Users can upload the NFT metadata to IPFS, and the application links the NFTs to their respective metadata using the IPFS hash.

# Ethereum Wallet Integration
The dApp integrates with the Metamask wallet, allowing users to connect their wallets and sign transactions seamlessly. Users can also acquire test ether from the provided Faucet for gas fees.


Project Structure
The project structure is organized as follows:

app.jsx: Contains the React application source code.
contracts: Includes the Solidity smart contract code for the NFTs.
README.md: This file, containing project documentation.
